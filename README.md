## Project Overview

This project is a Windows x64 calculator application implemented entirely in assembly language using the NASM assembler. It serves as an educational tool to explore low-level programming concepts, system calls, and the x86-64 architecture. The application supports basic arithmetic operations and provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

The project was inspired by the Win64 HelloWorld example provided by [mcandre](https://gist.github.com/mcandre/b3664ffbeb4f5764b36a397fafb04f1c) and extends it to include more complex functionality.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Accepts user input for calculations and commands.
- **Help Menu**: Displays usage instructions and supported operations.
- **Unicode and UTF-8 Support**: Handles both Unicode and UTF-8 strings for input and output.
- **Educational Focus**: Demonstrates key concepts of x86-64 assembly programming, including register usage, system calls, and memory management.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you will need the following tools and environment:

1. **NASM Assembler**: [Download NASM](https://nasm.us/) to compile the assembly files.
2. **Visual Studio Build Tools**: [Download Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/downloads/?q=build+tools) to link the compiled object files into an executable.
3. **Windows Environment**: The application is designed for Windows x64 systems.

> **Tip**: You can install the required tools using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install). Run the following command in an elevated PowerShell terminal:

```bash
choco install nasm visualstudio2022buildtools visualstudio2022-workload-vctools
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtmarco87/calculator-asm.git
cd calculator-asm
```

### Setup Steps

1. **Add NASM to PATH**: Ensure the NASM binary folder is added to your `PATH` environment variable. This step is necessary for the `makefile` to locate the assembler.

2. **Ensure Build Environment Setup**: The build process automatically detects and configures the required Visual Studio build environment (`vcvarsall.bat`) using the `vswhere.exe` tool. If Visual Studio is installed, no manual configuration is needed.

   If autodetection fails, ensure the following:

   - Visual Studio is installed with the "C++ Build Tools" workload.
   - The `vswhere.exe` utility is available in its default installation path:
     ```
     C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can manually specify the `VS_VERSION` (e.g., `VS_VERSION=2017`, `VS_VERSION=2022`) or provide the full path to `vcvarsall.bat` using the `VCVARSALL_PATH` variable in the `make` command.

### Building the Application

The build process is automated using a `makefile` for simplicity. Run the following command to assemble and link the application:

```bash
make
```

#### Detailed Build Steps

**Note**: The steps below are provided for informational purposes only. You do not need to execute them manually if you are using the `make` command. The `makefile` automates these steps for you.

1. **Assemble the Object File**:
   ```bash
   nasm -f win64 calculator.asm -o out\calculator.obj -g
   ```
2. **Set Up the Build Environment**:

   ```bash
   # Step 1: Use vswhere.exe to locate vcvarsall.bat
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe" -latest -products * -requires Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 -find **/vcvarsall.bat

   # Example Output (for Visual Studio 2022):
   # C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat

   # Step 2: Call vcvarsall.bat with the amd64 argument to set up the environment
   call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
   ```

3. **Link the Executable**:
   ```bash
   link /entry:start /subsystem:console out\calculator.obj kernel32.lib
   ```

**Note**: If you encounter issues with the `makefile`, you can use the batch script `scripts/createapp.bat calculator.asm` as an alternative. Alternatively, you may execute the build steps manually as described above.

## Usage

### How to Run

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   out\calculator.exe
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Enter `h` to display the help menu.
   - Enter `q` to quit the application.
   - Enter an arithmetic expression (e.g., `5 + 3`) to calculate the result.

### Windows x64 Assembly Guidelines

When working with assembly on Windows, keep the following in mind:

- **Reserved Registers**: Microsoft reserves the following registers for its own use:
  - **RBX**, **RBP**, **RSI**, **RDI**, **R12-R15**.
  - If you use these registers, save their values on the stack and restore them before returning.
- **Win64 Function Call Convention**: The first four parameters of a function are passed in the following registers:
  - **RCX**, **RDX**, **R8**, **R9**.
  - Additional parameters are passed on the stack.
- **Stack Requirements (Win64 home space)**: Before making a function call, reserve 32 bytes of stack space plus 16 bytes for alignment. Ensure this space is zeroed out for proper function execution.

**Note**: For more details on the Windows-specific behavior described above, you can refer to the [University of Alaska Fairbanks x86/x64 Reference](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2017/fall/cs301/reference/x86_64.html).

### Debugging

- **[x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/)**: A powerful debugger for Windows x86/x64 applications. It is highly recommended for debugging and reverse engineering assembly code.
